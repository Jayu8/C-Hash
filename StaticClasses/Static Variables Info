1) These Variables are shareable (Like Global)(Gloabal if public static)
2) Exist throughout runtime.
3) In C stored in .Data segment if initialised and in .BSS segment if uninitialised
4) Stored seperately from stack and Heap.

Example of Global

class Cow
{
 public static int numInstances;  //This is a Global can be called from any class
}
Main
{
 Cow.numInstances=123; // no instance required directly CLASS name
}
